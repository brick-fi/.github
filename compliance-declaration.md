# Executive Summary

BrickFi is a RealFi platform designed to represent and distribute real estate–linked rental income flows on-chain in a transparent and verifiable manner.
The platform does not facilitate property ownership transfer, real estate sales, or the issuance of regulated financial instruments. BrickFi focuses on providing technical infrastructure and information tools for income distribution logic, while maintaining awareness of applicable regulatory considerations.

## 1. Nature and Scope of the Service

BrickFi does not operate as a real estate trading, brokerage, or ownership transfer service.

Instead, BrickFi focuses on rental income flows associated with real estate assets and provides a technical framework to represent and distribute such income on-chain.
* Tokens used within BrickFi do not represent legal ownership, equity, securities, or debt instruments
* Tokens do not confer legal claims or enforceable rights over underlying real-world assets
* Tokens are used solely to express proportional participation within a predefined income distribution logic

## 2. Regulated Assets Disclosure

BrickFi acknowledges that real estate–linked income structures may conceptually fall within the broader category of Real World Assets (RWA) or RealFi.

However, BrickFi does not engage in the following regulated activities:
* Transfer or registration of legal property ownership
* Execution or facilitation of real estate sale or lease contracts
* Collection, custody, or management of real user funds
* Issuance or sale of securities, equity interests, or debt instruments
* Offering of legally binding financial products or investment contracts

Accordingly, BrickFi operates as a technology and information platform, not as a regulated financial intermediary or asset issuer.

## 3. Income Distribution Logic

BrickFi provides an automated, rule-based income distribution mechanism:
* Distribution follows predefined logic based on token balances
* All distributions are recorded as on-chain transactions and are publicly verifiable
* BrickFi supplies the infrastructure for distribution but does not guarantee income occurrence, amount, or performance

The platform enables transparency of distribution mechanics without making financial promises.

## 4. User Protection and Information Principles

BrickFi adheres to the following principles to support informed decision-making:
* No misleading, exaggerated, or guaranteed return claims are presented
* AI-generated insights are designed to provide balanced, professional, and objective information
* Investment decisions remain the sole responsibility of the user

BrickFi positions AI features as decision-support tools rather than financial advice.

## 5. Regulatory Awareness and Forward-Looking Approach

BrickFi is designed with an understanding that real estate–linked financial services may be subject to regulatory requirements across jurisdictions.

As the platform evolves, BrickFi intends to:
* Monitor relevant legal and regulatory developments
* Assess applicable compliance obligations where necessary
* Introduce appropriate safeguards, disclosures, and controls in alignment with local regulations

BrickFi’s long-term vision emphasizes responsible innovation within the evolving RealFi landscape.

# BrickFi — One-Pager Pitch

## One-line Introduction
BrickFi is a RealFi MVP that enables global real estate income participation from $50, with transparent on-chain distribution.

---

## Problem
Real estate investing remains inaccessible for most individuals.
* High capital requirements and interest burden
* Complex contracts and expensive intermediaries
* Limited access to global and remote investments
* Opaque rental income distribution

REITs lower entry barriers but bundle multiple assets together, making single-property income participation and transparent verification difficult.

---

## Solution
BrickFi focuses on rental income, not property ownership.

Users participate in rental income from a single property, receive cashflow tokens, and earn income distributed automatically on-chain based on token ownership.

**Key features include:**
* **Investment decision views** with yield, stability, and risk indicators
* **AI-powered investment insights** highlighting both strengths and risks
* **On-chain income distribution** verifiable via blockchain transactions

---

## Business Model (Core Revenue Engine)
BrickFi operates a multi-layered revenue model aligned with platform usage and scalable infrastructure.

### 1. Core Platform Fees (Usage-Based)
* **Investment Fee**
  A 2% platform fee applied to investments of $50 or more
* **Asset Listing Fee**
  Fees charged when properties or income assets are registered on the platform
* **Distribution Fee**
  A service fee applied when rental income is automatically distributed on-chain

These fees are tied directly to platform activity and usage, not asset sales.

---

### 2. AI & Data-Driven Premium Services
* AI Investment Insights (Advanced)
* AI Real Estate Agent / Chatbot for decision support
* Customized Investment Reports
* Enterprise Analytics & User Behavior Data for institutional partners

Offered via subscriptions or per-use pricing.

---

### 3. Asset Visibility & Promotion
* Property Boosting & Featured Listings
* Banner Advertising for Selected Assets or Partners

Monetized through paid placement without affecting core distribution logic.

---

## Roadmap
* **MVP**: Single property, cashflow token minting, on-chain income distribution
* **Expansion**: Multiple properties and broader RWA income assets
* **Vision**: AI-powered virtual 3D property tours and AI broker assistance for fully remote investment decisions
